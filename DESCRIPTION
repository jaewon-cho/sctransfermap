Description: sctransfermap trains side information (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, or cell ontology) and single-cell data (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq) with zero-shot learing. sctransfermap could easily merge additional data with pre-existing trained model. By trained model, sctransfermap could predict cell type from query scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq. In addition, sctransfermap could predict the origin of tissue by logistic regression.
